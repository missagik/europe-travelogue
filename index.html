            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>If, by chance, you were looking for an endless amount of stairs, you would be in luck visiting London! Amongst London's plentiful number of stairs, lies gorgeous architecture, beautiful views, and intriguing history. My visit was sure to include the infamous Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and the London Eye, The London Tower and Bridge, The Sky Gardens and Saint Paul's Cathedral.</p>
            <p>From those, my favourite in regards to history was Westminster Abbey for sure, an audio tour provided insight into events that happened in the very same place you were walking through in that moment. The architecture was also stunning, and never failed to impress me. For architecture though, Big Ben does take the trophy home, as it is just so iconic and gorgeous to finally see in person.</p>

            <h2>Paris</h2>
            <p>- Note to self (or anyone who'd like to visit), Bring an umbrella!!</p>
            <p>While I had heard Paris was a rainy city, I somehow had not anticipated that much rain. On the first day, our whole day involved walking, and surprisingly enough, it poured the whole day. I mistakenly wore a dress, which stuck to my legs as I walked all day. (Note: don't wear a dress either.)</p>
            <p>Besides the rain jokes! One of my favourite memories (ever!) was from my time in Paris. The first night my family and I arrived, it was lightly raining, and we walked around, exploring areas close to our hotel. One of the first places we stopped was Les Colonnes de Buren, a popular art installation with the black and white striped poles. It was late and quiet, and there was no one there. My sister and I danced in the court in the rain, it was incredible. We then headed to see the Louvre, which was freshly sprinkled in a light layer of rain, which also made it quiet and incredibly peaceful. I got one of my best and favourite photos to date there, shown ***.</p>
            <p>All of our destinations in Paris included; La Sainte Chapelle, La Panthéon, Notre Dame, Le Arc de Triomphe, a climb up to the top of the Eiffel Tower! and an incredible bakery called Angelina's. Seeing the Eiffel Tower sparkle was truly a magical experience that I would highly recommend.</p>

        <section id="barcelona">
            <h2>Barcelona</h2>
            <p>While I'd say the architecture of London and Paris are very well known for being gorgeous and well done, in my eyes, nothing beats or compares to the work of Antoni Gaudí. His architecture and the ways in which he gets his insipration are unlike anything I have ever seen before.  You can not visit Barcelona wihtout seeing the Basílica de la Sagrada Família, which also absolutely steals Big Ben's trophy. Besides lovely views, Barcelona also offered absolutely lovely weather, some of the warmest I have ever personally experienced, in fact. </p>
            <p>The Basílica de la Sagrada Família is incredible, with a construction timeline beginning in 1882, it is an incredibly intricate building. The walls on the inside lined with rainbow stained glass, going nearly floor to ceiling, with a ceiling stretching hundreds of feet above your head. His work is said to all be inspired by nature, reflected in his designed by staircases that wind like the spiral on a snail's shell for just one example. A truly breathtaking thing to experience.</p>
            <p>In Barcelona, we visited Casa Mila, Casa Batlló and Casa Amatller, all of Gaudí's creations. We also explored a food market, walked by the Cathedral of Barcelona, went to an aquarium, and saw (and swam in) the ocean for the first time!</p>
